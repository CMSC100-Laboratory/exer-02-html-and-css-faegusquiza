**Steps on How to Create a GitHub Page:**
1. Upload or push an “index.html” file into the repository.
2. Go to “Settings” and under “Code and automation,” click “Pages.”
3. Under “Build and deployment,” select a branch, like “main” for “Branch,” then click “Save.”
4. Refresh the page to access the live link of the GitHub page.
5. Publishing a site takes a while, so the contents will only be seen after a while.

**Key Takeaways from the Exercise:**
- The exercise was a good refresher after doing HTML and CSS over a year ago in CMSC 12. I was able to review the syntax used, while also applying the knowledge I learned from the lesson last week on Git. This exercise made me feel like an actual developer, so I enjoyed it.
